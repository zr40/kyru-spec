Kyru - Secure peer-to-peer file storage
=======================================

The Kyru repository is divided into several main branches:

* *master*: contains the protocol specification. It's the branch you're looking at now!
* [protobuf](https://github.com/zr40/kyru/tree/protobuf): contains the Protobuf message definition. It's used to merge changes into the implementation branches.
* [ruby](https://github.com/zr40/kyru/tree/ruby): contains the Ruby implementation of a Kyru node.
